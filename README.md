# splitting_dataset
Splitting a dataset might also be important for detecting if your model suffers from one of two very common problems, called underfitting and overfitting:
Underfitting is usually the consequence of a model being unable to encapsulate the relations among data.
Overfitting usually takes place when a model has an excessively complex structure and learns both the existing relations among data and noise.
